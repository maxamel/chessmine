# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace the line below with your
# domain name.


#{
#    experimental_http3
#}

# Remove http:// to enable TLS
http://chesslune.com

# Set this path to your site's directory.
root * /var/www/html/


# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
route {
        @notStatic {
                path /api/* /socket.io/*
        }
        reverse_proxy @notStatic game_server:5000
        try_files {path}.html {path}
        file_server

}

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
