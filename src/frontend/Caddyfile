# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace the line below with your
# domain name.

# Remove http:// to enable TLS

# Set this path to your site's directory.
root * /var/www/html/


# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
route {
        @notStatic {
                path /api/* /socket.io/*
        }
        root * static/
        reverse_proxy @notStatic {$BE_URL}:5000
        try_files {path} {path}.html html/{path}.html
        redir /stockfish.wasm /js/stockfish.wasm
        file_server

}
